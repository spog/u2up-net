Identities, Addresses, Contacts, ...
------------------------------------
In general, identity represents a unique person / object / node and is
being issued by one of a trusted authority.

As a supplement to identity, addresses provide means of access to the
person's / object's / node's identity. Generally, multiple addresses
may be assigned to one's identity.

Let's make an analogy from people's social network. For the sake of
simplicity let's assume, that there are no modern communication means
other than physical traveling and people's living addresses.
Association of a preson's identity and its living addresses is called
a contact.

To maintain contacts people ask them selves two questions:
1. Where (at which address) does a particular person live?
   (Where does one live?)

2. Which person lives at one particular address?
   (Who lives there? - knock, knock...)

To put those questions into a modern perspective of IP / DNS resolution.
1. The first question corresponds to the forward name lookup.
   (Which IP address is to be used to access a particular domain name?).

2. The reverse name lookup may be seen as analogy of the second question.
   (Which domain name would have been accessesd using a particular living
   address?)

Randomly generate network nodes
-------------------------------
In this simulation sequential issued Node ID numbers represent global
identity of each node (analoguous to person's ID card in real life or
like a traditional domain name / certificate of a host).

On the other hand Node Address is randomly picked from the available
one-dimensional address space (i.e. unsigned N-bit number).

User provides an argument about how many nodes would be created in one
batch every second. Additional argument defines the maximun number of
all nodes.

A separate (authority) thread handles generation of new nodes. It plays
a role of a Node ID issuing authority. A new node gets sequetially
assigned ID. Initially the authority thread also randomly picks a free
Node Address.
