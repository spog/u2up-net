Description:
------------
The "automk" project serves as a template for building software projects.
It provides a framework to help adding build rules to your source tree.

Usage:
------
To able to use this template, copy the "automk" subdirectory into the
home directory of your source tree (you may also create symlinks to
create initial "configure" and "Makefile" like in this template example).

You need to add a "config.mk" file to each subdirectory of your
source tree. A "config.mk" variable "SUBMAKES" has to be defined to
specify all current directory specific target make files and subdirectories
required to dive into. Order of target make files and subdirectories in a
current "config.mk" also define build order of those targets.

For each specific target make file, targets "all", "clean" and "install"
need to be defined (check this template samples).

It automatically adds out-of-tree build capability to your projects.

Build commands:
"Configure":
~~~~~~~~~~~~
project_home$ env BUILDIR=./build PREFIX=/usr/local ./configure

or (using cross-toolchain)

project_home$ env BUILDIR=./build PREFIX=/usr/local ENVSH=/home/samo/Yocto-RPI3/eSDK/environment-setup-cortexa7hf-neon-vfpv4-poky-linux-gnueabi ./configure

"Build":
~~~~~~~~
project_home$ make

"Install":
~~~~~~~~~~
project_home$ env DESTDIR=$(pwd)/../install make install

"Clean":
~~~~~~~~
project_home$ make clean

---
End!
